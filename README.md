### Database Design
  There are 3 major entities in the system.:
   1. User: this represent a customer and it holds details such as the customer's email,fisrtname,lastname,password.
   2. Wallet: this represent the customer's wallet. each customer in the system has a wallet. The entity contains fields such as: walletId,balance,userId e.t.c
   3. Transaction: keeps track of the transaction made by the customer. it fields include: transactionRef,summary,description e.t.c

   Below is an entity relationship diagram illustrating the relationship among these models:

### Technologies Used
 * Node.js
 * Express.js
 * Typescript
 * KnexORM
 * JWT: for authentication
 * FlutterWave API: for payment integration
